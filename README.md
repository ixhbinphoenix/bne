Web-app built for extending Untis, for better planning.

>Note: if you don´t already know what this project is, it´s probably not for you.

With the interface you can display your weekly schedule with the addition of showing your moveable self-learning lessons, which Untis doesn´t show. TheSchedule has faster loading time and easier visibility of which lesson is cancelled and which lesson is just moved or substituted.
